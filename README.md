## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. 

## Portfolio

Here are some projects I have developed!

* Flask Finance - A finance tracker built with Flask. Uses Flask-Security-Too for user registration, and Render Postgres for data storage. Pushes generate live coverage reports, and the project was developed using agile methods which are documented in the Issues and Projects tabs in the repo. [Repository](https://github.com/KevLoughrey/FinanceApp) Â· [Deployment](https://financeapp-x3ki.onrender.com/)
* URL Shortener - A basic URL shortener built with Go and React. Users can shorten URLs, and when visited, shortened URLs will redirect to the correct website and count the number of visits. These stats can be viewed in the app. [Repository](https://github.com/KevLoughrey/url-shortener) Â· [Deployment](https://url-shortener-fdue.onrender.com/)
* Fishing Game - A JS canvas game developed in 48 hours to demonstrate OOP proficiency and code architecture skills. [Repository](https://github.com/KevLoughrey/FishingGame) Â· [Deployment](https://kevloughrey.github.io/FishingGame/)
* Father Ted Quotes - Several years ago, I was tasked in work with creating a Google Chrome Extension. As practice, I built this extension for fun over the course of a few hours. It receives a random quote from the Father Ted Quotes API and displays it in a popup window in the browser. It was later published to the Chrome Web Store.
